# Logistic-Regression-and-Gaussian-Discriminant-Analysis
Data analysis and reporting on methods and results using Python code.
Problem 1: Logistic Regression
In this problem, you will build a binary classifier using logistic regression to plant type in Fisher's Iris data set according to four multivariate features which are sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. You will perform the classifiers using logistic regression (without using existing libraries) to if the plant type is Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica. To build the classifiers, you need to perform the following steps:
1.
Load the Iris data set dataset from CSV file or from sklearn library.
2.
Divided the dataset randomly into testing and training with a splitting ration of (70:30).
3.
Train a linear regression model using a gradient descent algorithm with learning rate ùú∂=0.1.
4.
Record and plot the cost at each iteration against iterations.
5.
Test the performance of the model by computing and reporting the accuracy on the testing set.
Problem 2: Gaussian Discriminant Analysis
In this problem, you will build a binary classifier to predict plant type in Fisher's Iris data set according to multivariate features (same dataset used in the previous question). You will perform classifiers using multivariate normal discriminant analysis (without using existing libraries) to predict if the plant type is Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica. To build the classifiers, you need to perform the following steps:
1.
Load the Iris data set dataset from CSV file or from sklearn library.
2.
Divided the dataset randomly into testing and training with a splitting ration of (70:30).
3.
Estimate the discriminant function for each class (mean and covariance) using the training set.
4.
Test the performance of the model by computing and reporting the accuracy on the testing set.
5.
Which model logistic regression or Gaussian Discriminant Analysis perform better and why ?
